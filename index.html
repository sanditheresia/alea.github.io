<p style="text-align:center">It turns out I have to let you go, and not be happy together with you. <br>I just realized that letting go is also a part of loving, and sooner or later I have to truly be able to release you, let you be happy with your choice, and try to be okay seeing you happy even though it's not my happiness. <br>I'm confused whether to be happy or sad? I'm happy to have met you, Jaga diri baik baik ya!
